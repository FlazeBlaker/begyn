✅ What to CHANGE (ONLY THESE THINGS)
✅ 1️⃣ Add / Fix Homepage SEO (DO THIS)

Yes, change this

Make sure your homepage has:

1 clear H1 with keywords
👉 AI Social Media Guide to Become an Influencer

SEO title includes AI Social Media Guide

First paragraph clearly explains what Begyn does

❌ Don’t change UI
❌ Don’t change branding
✅ Only text + structure

✅ 2️⃣ Create ONE Strong Keyword Page

Yes, you must do this

Create:

/ai-social-media-guide


This page is what Google will rank — without it, ranking won’t happen.

No need for 10 pages yet.
Just 1 good page, properly done.

✅ 3️⃣ Add Supporting Content Slowly

Yes, but small

1–2 blogs per week

Link them to your guide page

That’s it.
No mass posting. No AI spam.

❌ What NOT to change (important)

❌ Don’t change domain
❌ Don’t redesign UI
❌ Don’t stuff keywords
❌ Don’t buy backlinks
❌ Don’t keep checking Google every day

These slow you down.

🧠 Analogy (to make it clear)

Right now Google sees:

“This is a nice-looking brand site.”

You need Google to see:

“This is THE site about AI social media guidance.”

That only happens when:

A clear guide page exists

Supporting content exists

Time passes

✅ So the correct move is:

✅ Small SEO changes
✅ One main content page
✅ Consistency
✅ Patience
